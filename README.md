Greetings Fellow Programmer,

If you want to play around with my maze file, do gcc maze.c (the maze.c file is the most updated file)

Then you would a.out (mazetextfile.txt), where mazetestfile is any file name with the word maze in it ending with a .txt extension.

Feel free to explore the other things I have here.

Cheers,

Jethro Chan
